### What I learned

I really liked the idea of having some elements rendered in the DOM just to have some clean animations which is what i did in this challenge

```html
<div class="hero__slides flex" aria-live="polite">
  <!-- Slide 1 -->
  <div
    class="hero__slide hero__slide--active"
    role="group"
    aria-roledescription="slide"
    aria-label="1 of 3"
  >
    <h2 class="hero__title">Discover innovative ways to decorate</h2>
    <p class="hero__description">

    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Slide 2 -->
  <div
    class="hero__slide hidden"
    role="group"
    aria-roledescription="slide"
    aria-label="2 of 3"
  >
    <h2 class="hero__title">We are available all across the globe</h2>

    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Slide 3 -->
  <div
    class="hero__slide hidden"
    role="group"
    aria-roledescription="slide"
    aria-label="3 of 3"
  >
    <h2 class="hero__title">Manufactured with the best materials</h2>

    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```scss
&__pictures picture {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  opacity: 0;

  z-index: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}
```

```js
function switchSlide(fromIndex, toIndex, direction) {
  const fromPic = pictures[fromIndex];
  const toPic = pictures[toIndex];
  const fromSlide = slides[fromIndex];
  const toSlide = slides[toIndex];

  // Remove active states
  fromPic.classList.remove("active");
  fromSlide.classList.remove("hero__slide--active");
  fromSlide.classList.add("hidden");

  // Add active states
  toPic.classList.add("active");
  toSlide.classList.remove("hidden");
  toSlide.classList.add("hero__slide--active");
}
```

### Continued development

I want to do complex animations in the future
